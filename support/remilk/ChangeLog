	* rtm.py: Implemented the full RTM API. Integrated simplejson to
	  handle JSON responses, which should fix some encoding problems.
	  Renamed some internal attributes (name, auth) of RTM class,
	  because they where conflicting with some methods and arguments
	  of the API calls wich had the same name. Fixed a minor issue
	  with dottedDict class and non dict instances. Added a simple
	  mechanism to turn debugging on/off dynamically.
	* README / ChangeLog: Added.
